# Python Projects

A collection of Python projects I've made over the years.

## Run Locally

Follow these steps to clone and run any of the projects on your local machine:  

### Prerequisites  
Ensure you have the following installed:  
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (latest stable version recommended)  
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)  

### Steps  

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   
   Open your terminal or command prompt and run:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vams-skn/python-projects.git
   ```
   Then navigate into the project directory:  
   ```bash
   cd python-projects
   ```

2. **Navigate to Required Project Folder & Install Dependencies**  
   
   A few of the projects may have dependencies. Navigate to the project folder and install the required packages:  
   ```bash
   cd <project-folder-name>
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   If no `requirements.txt` exists, manually install necessary packages using:  
   ```bash
   pip install <package-name>
   ```

3. **Run the Project**  
   
   Execute the Python script:  
   ```bash
   python <name>.py
   ```
   (Replace `<name>` with the correct filename for the project.)

Explore and modify the projects to your needs!
